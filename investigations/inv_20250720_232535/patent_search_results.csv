AT-E555615-T1,,"The present invention relates to a method of logging or recording input signal data of a hearing prosthesis in combination with values of one or several variables associated with the hearing prosthesis. The hearing prosthesis variable(s) may comprise logic states of a single or several user-controllable actuator(s) mounted on the prosthesis and/or values of algorithm parameters of a predetermined digital signal processing algorithm executed in the prosthesis. Hereby, error tracking and performance optimisation are facilitated since anomalous or sub-optimal operating conditions of signal processing algorithms and/or user interface control handling or other undesired events may be detected. By recording both the hearing prosthesis variable or variables and the input signal data, it is e.g. possible to identify and track correlations between one or several predetermined signal events in the input signal data and effects to the operation of the hearing prosthesis derived there from. &lt;IMAGE&gt;",,GN RESOUND AS,20120515,['A61F11/00' 'H04R25/00'],0.10900004181392364,0.2764739699591298,0.10894822466208683,0.1676029623767866
