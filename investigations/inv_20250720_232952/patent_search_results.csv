EE-01604-U1,A method for determining the calorific value of oil shale using a statistical distribution graph of digital image elements,"In industry, it is necessary to determine the calorific value of oil shale in real time in order to choose the right processing method based on the quality of the oil shale. This invention is based on the fact that the calorific value is positively influenced by the content of the organic component - kerogen. The distribution of combustible and non-combustible components in oil shale is uneven, the human eye cannot distinguish the difference in color of oil shale samples with different calorific values. But these slight differences in color are sufficient for a maschine learning model to determine the calorific value from a digital photo. These models were trained on samples of 8 calorific value classes. In the implementation of the invention, 5 main stages are distinguished: taking a digital photo on the production line; converting a photo into a number vector; attribute engineering, which consist the pixel counting of each color channel in specific intensity ranges and normalizing the results; feeding attributes of machine learning models; classifying the sample into one of eight calorific value classes.",,TALLINNA TEHNIKAUELIKOOL,20230717,['G01N21/25'],0.19698035510595702,0.2620249757985332,0.10003102840496848,0.19550864067311155

TN-2015000042-A1,System for automatically matching a service requestor with a service provider based on their proximity and establishing a voice call between them,"A system for automatically matching a service requestor with a service provider based on their physical proximity to each other. A client requesting a service (e.g. Taxi service) using a cellular telephone calls an automatic server. The server interfaces with the cellular operator(s) systems and acquires the client&#39;s location. The server also regularly keeps track of the locations and availability of pre-registered service providers (e.g. Taxi Cabs) through the same interface with the cellular operator(s). The server then matches the service requestor with a service provider based on the physical proximity of the latter to the former through a matching algorithm. Once the matching is performed, the server establishes a voice call where the service requestor is the call originator (A-Party) and the service provider is the call recipient (B-Party) so both parties can verbally agree on the details of their transaction.",,STONETHROW TELECOMMUNICATIONS LTD,20160629,['H04W8/18' 'G06Q10/08' 'H04W4/029' 'H04W4/02'],0.1468386911873582,0.16970675256631612,0.10003102840496855,0.14314059697439607
