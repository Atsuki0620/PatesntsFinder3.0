NZ-765120-A,Method for preparing dairy product based on principle of forward osmosis,"Generally, the traditional concentration method for cow milk concentration removes water in the cow milk by heating. However, due to the high temperature treatment, this operation causes great damage to the nutrient retention and the flavour of the cow milk itself, and brings about adverse consequences such as yellowing of the colour and heavy cooking taste, seriously affecting the product quality of dairy products. Moreover, the energy consumption of the evaporation process in the conventional concentration method is relatively large. A continuous forward osmosis membrane system is disclosed which utilises forward osmosis membrane modules to concentrate milk without adverse effects to the quality of the milk product. The continuous forward osmosis membrane system comprises multiple forward osmosis membrane modules, one reverse osmosis membrane module for recovering a draw solution, raw material tank(s), product tank(s), and draw solution tank(s). Multiple forward osmosis membrane modules are connected to each other, and together with the raw material tank and the product tank constitute a feed cycle.
