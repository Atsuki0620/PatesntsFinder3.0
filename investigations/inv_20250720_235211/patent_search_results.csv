SK-10259-Y1,Intelligent and self-learning system for controlling the operation of an assembly machine,"The technical solution relates to an intelligent and self-learning method of controlling the operation of a assembly machine comprising at least one conveyor, a assembly or bumper-tread drum and a measuring camera system, to ensure the correct position of the material on the drum, which controls the adjustment of the ratios of the conveyor speed and the surface speed of the drum depending on measuring the width of the material stored on the drum.",,MESNAC EUROPEAN RES AND TECHNICAL CENTRE S R O SKRATENE „MERTC S R O “,20250129,['G01B11/00'],0.35154022788597317,0.39766060583583174,0.10774223627552676,0.3067328622658121
SK-10211-Y1,Machine tool automatic safety system protection device,"Machine tool automatic safety system protection device is intended for the woodworking industry, specifically for the application of machine learning of hazardous phenomena predictable from vibrations during machining on CNC woodworking machines. display unit in the form of an LCD display (2). Using the button (4), it is possible to record the vibration acceleration values ​​in the internal memory during machining. The stored values ​​form data sets as a training dataset for the programmed machine learning algorithm. If vibration accelerations are evaluated as risky, this information is displayed on the LCD display, or the electronic safety switch (6) is opened using electronic elements (5). This cuts off the power line to the protected device, causing its emergency stop. The automatic machine tool protection system device monitors the current value of the vibration acceleration from the integrated diagnostic member, while the allowable values ​​are learned with the help of the teacher/operator. After a sufficient number of cycles of machine learning of permissible values, it predicts gambling conditions, which it indicates on the display element, or causes an emergency stop of the machine.",,TECHNICKA UNIVERZITA VO ZVOLENE,20241218,['G05B19/048' 'B27C9/02'],0.282437992427853,0.27272156315740426,0.10774223627552676,0.2353633031451144
