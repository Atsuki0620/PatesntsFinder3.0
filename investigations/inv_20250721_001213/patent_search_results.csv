MY-201302-A,"Data type recognition, model training and risk recognition methods, apparatuses and devices","The present application provides data type recognition and model training methods and apparatuses, and computer devices. The model training method includes acquiring (102) a first sample data set, and using the first sample data set to train an anomaly detection model; and detecting (104) an abnormal sample data set from a second sample data set by means of the anomaly detection model, and using the abnormal sample data set to train a classification model. By means of this embodiment, an amount of scoring events of the classification model can be reduced, and relatively balanced sample data sets can also be provided for training, to obtain the classification model with a higher accuracy. In a particular application, data to be recognized is firstly input to the anomaly detection model, and whether the data to be recognized is first-type data can be quickly distinguished; and other data than the first-type data recognized by the anomaly detection model, is input to the classification model for recognition. The speed of online data recognition is relatively fast.
